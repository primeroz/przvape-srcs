### Why Cleaning your new Tank ?

Sometimes when vaping on a brand new RDA or other types of Tank we get a taste
like anything but the juice we just filled it up with.

Often Clones coming from China are spoiled with left-over machine oil from the
production line, this is also true for authentic tank which are indeed produced
in the 100s on the same machines that build our clones.

Also other left-over from the production process, like metal dust and metal
shavings, could be left on the tank or inside of it.

Fortunately a simple clean will be enough, in most cases, to fix those little
issue and provide the great vaping experience we are all after.

***Always, Always, Always clean your tanks before use***

### How to easily clean your tank

* **Take it apart**

First take your tank completely apart.
Inspect it for damages or left over metal parts.

Remove all the O-Rings

* **Alchool  cleanup**

If you have a 90% alchool solution use it for a quick rinse off in a small
container. Vodka is often used for this purpose

This will remove the most stubborn machine oil.

If you don't have any at your hands don't worry since the next step will take
care of most oil anyway.

Don't soak your O-Rings in Alchool as it might cause damage depending on the
material they are built of.

* **Soap Bath**

In a clean container mix some *unscented soap* with some vinaigrette and salt or
bicarbonate of soda. Fill with enough warm water to be able to completely
submerge all the parts of your tank

Some good reccomendation for soap are *Dawn* or *Fairy* original, they are the
same product marketed differently depending on where you happen to live.

Let your tank parts soak into the bath for a decent amount of time, 15 or 20
minutes should be plenty to remove all the nasty stuff from your tank.

Using a **tootbrush** scrab all parts , inside and outside.

For extra cleanliness you can repeat this step after rinsing all parts under
running warm water in a new clean container with a clean mix of soap and the
other parts.

* **Rinse and Dry**

Rinse all parts extremely well under running warm water , let all part to air
dry completely.
